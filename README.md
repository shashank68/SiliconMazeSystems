## Guidelines for maintaining the repo.

1. In each of the category-directories, the README file should be maintained in the following manner.

```
1. Challenge1-name	Points	<flag>
2. Challenge2-name	Points	<flag>
.
.
.
```

## Guidelines for adding a challenge

1. Add an entry like above for that challenge in the category-directory's README.
1. Make a directory for each challenge in the respective category-directory. Everything related to that challenge should be present in that directory.
2. For each challenge-dir, create a README. Specify what is to be uploaded onto the website. 
	* Eg: For pwn, generally both executable and C-sourcefile are uploaded, but for RE only executable is uploaded. 
	* So, need to be clear on what is given to participants to solve that challenge.
	* And anything about the chal you feel is important, add here.
