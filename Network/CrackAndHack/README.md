# Question: 
Generally, a lot of hacks take place on a network. If a person is able to gain access to a network, he/she can get a lot of data from the clients of the network. Here is a cap file that contains 4-way wifi authentication handshake for a WPA2 secured network. Raj saw Rahul connecting to this network and remembers the pattern of the password as T@@@%%68, where @ is any lowercase character and % is any numeral. Can you crack the password for Raj?

#### Hint: crunch + aircrack-ng or hashcat
