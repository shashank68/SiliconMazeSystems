Manan - I have some ideas, please help me or update/frame questions :

1. We can hide “key” in the source code of web pages like CSS files etc.
2. We can give multiple images which can point to one-word answers like pictorial combination of  “imitation game” + “are you a machine or a human photo” + “homosexual” = “alan turing”
